// HOLIDAY-awareness: which planning-window days a HOLIDAY calendar event
// covers, and what (if anything) to push on them.
//
// Two API facts drive the shape of this module (both verified against the live
// API, 2026-07-22):
//   1. The events endpoint filters on *start* date only — a holiday that began
//      before the queried range is not returned even when it overlaps it, so
//      callers must fetch with a lookback (config.holidays.lookback_days).
//   2. A multi-day event's end_date_local is an exclusive midnight bound: a
//      holiday shown Aug 2-14 on the calendar reads back as
//      start 2026-08-02T00:00:00, end 2026-08-15T00:00:00.

const dayKey = (d: string): string => d.slice(0, 10);

// Last calendar day an event covers. A midnight end on a later day is
// exclusive (see above); an end with any other time, an end equal to the
// start, or no end at all means the event is contained in its final day.
// "Midnight" tolerates format drift — a bare date, optional seconds,
// fractional seconds, and a Z/offset suffix all count, so a future API change
// like "T00:00:00.000" can't silently extend every holiday by one day.
